# Welcome To GMG
Here I will be sharing all my progress and continual updates on my App that I am building

## An App Built For NFTs
The Idea for this app came to fruition as it was an idea to use for my Cousera UX Cert progrect
- Through the course I actually noticed that this idea could bring value and a new way to explore NFTs
- So I am taking my ideas and going to work to implement them into what i see as my long term vision.

### What App Is GMG
Right now since I am only in the ideate phase I plan on keeping things hush until i see how feasable this project can be
- I want to be transparent about what I am building and would love the help of the community to expand on the project over time. 
- My long term vision is big picture and I and long term focused for the betterment of the ENTIRE space.
 I am hoping to connect with people that would want to build a product that will be beneficial to all who find value in it.
- This project as it sits has many avenues and features to implement and as time goes on I want to make sure every step of the way will be community focused to make the best app that everyone wants to use.

### Why Is It On Github
For this project I am working solo. I am self taught / self teaching all aspect in development and I know this is not something I can build without help.
- I feel like sharing the process of building this project and up to almost the final product that if anyone within the community has the ability to and wants to test ideas to make this better, that is my end goal. 
- If we create together we can all benefit together. 
- I would love help from anyone who wants to offer it and even join me on my journey to build. 


 ### I will be doing my best to update this everyday. Along with keeping a running log and updates. 

 - 10/10/22 -> working on homepage outline on index file. Deciding on a design and what i plan to have the homepage look like. For now it is an on-goingly slow html design as i configure my ideas to layout. 

- This is just a basic informational message to get some ideas written out. 
- Please feel free to reach out to me with questions, comments, interest and anything else. 


I will be sharing updates over time on [My Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/mirenda_eth) so you can follow along there as time comes to fruition.
